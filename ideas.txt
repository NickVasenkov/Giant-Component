TASKS:
save and load models
extract policies (for a given state individually)
analyze policies: graph probabilities as following: x-axis: the size of left choice
y-axis: the size of right choice. hue: probability of making left choice

TO OBSERVE:

difference between first pair and second pair
graph size
neighbors
difference between the new component and maximum of the two components added
(will be zero if nodes are in the same component)
same component or different
edge matrix
four component sizes (shall differenciate if vertices are in same component)
product of component sizes (just the component size or zero, if in the same component)


APPROACHES:
a version of the game allows double edges and edges from a node to itself
